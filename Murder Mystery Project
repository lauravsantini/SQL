--In this project, I answered the questions in the SQL Challenge - Murder Mystery to solve the case and find the killer

--A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​

--Witness 1
I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
Witness 2
I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
